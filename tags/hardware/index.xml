      <description>Introduction This post presents the article by Park et al. entitled &amp;ldquo;NoJITsu: Locking Down JavaScript Engines&amp;rdquo;. The authors present both an attack against JIT compilers (injecting malicious bytecodes) and a defense solution. We will focus on the defense part and look at the NoJITsu design in details along with its security and performance analysis.
NoJITsu Big Picture NoJITsu goal is to deploy fine-grained security policies around critical objects that are used at runtime by the VM.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post presents the article by Frassetto et al. entitled &amp;ldquo;JITGuard Hardening Just-in-time Compilers with SGX&amp;rdquo;. The authors present both an attack against JIT compilers (injecting malicious JIT intermediate representation) and a defense solution. We will focus on the defense part and look at the JITGuard design in details along with its security and performance analysis.
JITGuard Design JITGuard presents a number of measures to isolate the JIT components from each other and attackers.</description>
